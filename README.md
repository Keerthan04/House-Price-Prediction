House Price Prediction Model
Overview
This repository contains a machine learning model built to predict house prices based on a comprehensive dataset comprising various features like square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, neighborhood, and year built.

Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluating the model encompasses a diverse range of housing-related attributes. Key features include:

SquareFeet: Total square footage of the property.
Bedrooms and Bathrooms: Number of bedrooms and bathrooms in the house.
Neighborhood: Categorical feature representing the neighborhood where the house is located.
YearBuilt: Year when the property was built.
Price: The target variable, representing the price of the house.
Model Development
The machine learning model is based on the RandomForestRegressor algorithm from the Scikit-Learn library. The model has been trained on historical housing data to learn the relationships between various features and the final sale price.

Performance
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to assess the average difference between predicted and actual house prices. The current MAE achieved by the model stands at approximately [insert current MAE here].

Usage
To use this model:
